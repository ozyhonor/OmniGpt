00:00->00:02
- [Narrator] Here are eight
steps to (censored) your life.
00:02->00:06
Step one, cleanse thy earthly vessel.
00:06->00:08
Shower. Get fresh.
00:08->00:10
Treat yourself with respect.
00:10->00:12
Brush your teeth, wear a scent,
00:12->00:13
because this is it.
00:13->00:15
This is the character you're playing as.
00:15->00:19
And if you fail to take care
of yourself on a basic level,
00:19->00:22
you'll fail outwards in space and time,
00:22->00:24
because it all starts with you.
00:24->00:26
Being clean and feeling fresh
00:26->00:30
as a ritual will increase your
self-perception over time.
00:30->00:32
You'll be putting your best foot forward
00:32->00:35
and will be signaling to your subconscious
00:35->00:36
that your worth taking care of.
00:36->00:39
So even if Yellowstone erupts
00:39->00:42
and the world descends
into chaos and destruction,
00:42->00:43
at least you'll smell good.
00:43->00:46
Step two, order the kingdom.
00:46->00:48
Clean your room.
00:48->00:50
Deep clean your house.
00:50->00:52
Get rid of all the shit
that's scattering your mind.
00:52->00:55
Refuse to live in a monument of filth
00:55->00:58
like an ever-present reminder
of things left undone,
00:58->01:03
because the space you occupy
is an extension of yourself.
01:03->01:04
Is it disordered?
01:04->01:06
Because if it is, so are you.
01:06->01:07
So take your pick.
01:07->01:10
You can order yourself
or order your kingdom.
01:10->01:13
It doesn't really matter
because it's the same thing.
01:13->01:15
No more half-done jobs.
01:15->01:18
Go room to room and make things right,
01:18->01:20
make things beautiful.
01:20->01:23
When you are clean, and
your kingdom is too,
01:23->01:26
then you'll feel like you have
your shit together somewhat.
01:26->01:28
And it will encourage
you to bring that energy
01:28->01:30
to the rest of your life.
01:30->01:33
Start with you and the things
that you have control over,
01:33->01:35
and then venture forth.
01:35->01:37
When you have your ducks in a row,
01:37->01:38
then get out of the house.
01:38->01:40
Rapunzel stayed in her tower
01:40->01:43
because she was emotionally manipulated
01:43->01:44
by a devouring mother.
01:44->01:45
But what about you?
01:45->01:49
The human brain operates
best with our feet moving,
01:49->01:50
sun in our face,
01:50->01:52
and eyes moving from left to right.
01:52->01:56
Go outside because everyone's
wondering where you went.
01:56->01:59
We're meant to be in relationship
and community with others.
01:59->02:02
Become an initiator of
people coming together
02:02->02:03
and things happening,
02:03->02:06
because the modern world is
designed from the ground-up
02:06->02:08
to keep you inside.
02:08->02:11
We technically don't have
to leave the house ever.
02:11->02:13
So a lot of us don't.
02:13->02:15
And our lives pass us by.
02:15->02:17
Step four, sweat.
02:17->02:18
If I told you there was a pill
02:18->02:22
that was guaranteed to boost
your mental and physical energy
02:22->02:23
throughout the day,
02:23->02:26
increase your overall
mood and outlook on life,
02:26->02:30
improve your mental clarity,
prolong your lifespan,
02:30->02:33
and increase your physical attractiveness,
02:33->02:34
would you take that pill?
02:34->02:37
But that pill is real, and
it's called working out.
02:37->02:41
And the top performers in
the world take it every day.
02:41->02:42
So get the blood pumping.
02:42->02:44
Go break a sweat.
02:44->02:45
Do it daily,
02:45->02:48
because that which cost
us energy giveth energy.
02:48->02:51
Step five, monitor thy treasury.
02:51->02:53
Because giant corporations are thriving
02:53->02:55
on the fact that you don't,
02:55->02:57
they encourage unconscious spending
02:57->02:59
and auto-renewing subscriptions
02:59->03:02
that slowly bleed you of
your hard-earned cash.
03:02->03:04
And this out-of-sight,
03:04->03:06
out-of-mind attitude is keeping you stuck.
03:06->03:08
So check your balance daily.
03:08->03:10
Does it sting? Good.
03:10->03:14
Let that sting motivate you to
investigate what's going on.
03:14->03:17
What are you paying for
that you don't care about.
03:17->03:20
Exposing yourself to
the hard numbers unlocks
03:20->03:22
the ability to do something about it.
03:22->03:24
Step six, remove the hooks.
03:24->03:26
What are you bound to?
03:26->03:29
What are you dependent on in
order to operate at baseline?
03:29->03:34
What external substances
or behaviors are you using
03:34->03:36
to medicate internal problems?
03:36->03:38
Turn off notifications.
03:38->03:40
Stop getting pulled back into the cycle.
03:40->03:45
Unsubscribe to email chains,
unfollow Instagram accounts.
03:45->03:48
Remove things that
constantly pull you back
03:48->03:50
into mindless consumerism.
03:50->03:52
Step seven, strategize.
03:52->03:56
Every military operation,
political campaign,
03:56->03:59
major corporation relies on a strategy
03:59->04:01
to increase the chances of success.
04:01->04:04
If you were tasked to
run one of these entities
04:04->04:07
and you showed up without a strategy,
04:07->04:08
you'd be laughed out the door.
04:08->04:10
But what about your life?
04:10->04:13
Are you just floating
through without a strategy,
04:13->04:15
hoping you'll end up in a desirable place
04:15->04:16
five years down the line?
04:16->04:18
Well, I'm sorry to be the one to tell you,
04:18->04:21
but things don't usually
get better on their own.
04:21->04:25
Even a man of faith would be
a fool not to be proactive
04:25->04:26
with the tools God has given him,
04:26->04:28
for his sloth, not a sin.
04:28->04:30
So put the figures on the board.
04:30->04:32
What do you want in life?
04:32->04:35
And in what ways do you
tend to fail achieving it?
04:35->04:36
Develop a strategy
04:36->04:39
based on the information
you have available
04:39->04:40
and use this info
04:40->04:43
to figure out the most
effective way forward.
04:43->04:46
You'd be surprised as to
how monstrously effective
04:46->04:48
even a basic strategy can be.
04:48->04:51
Step eight, submit.
04:51->04:53
Submit to the things you must do,
04:53->04:56
because the thinking has
already been done by you.
04:56->04:59
Shut your mind off and relinquish yourself
04:59->05:01
of the burden of overthinking.
05:01->05:02
Learn what it feels like
05:02->05:05
to put your rationalization on mute.
05:05->05:08
Take a deep breath and
do what you need to do.
05:08->05:10
Trust the more authentic
voice in your head
05:10->05:13
and let it override your weaker self,
05:13->05:14
because over time,
05:14->05:17
this authentic self will
become your primary voice.
05:17->05:20
And the more you listen
to your authentic self,
05:20->05:24
the more you'll develop a
stronger sense of identity.
05:24->05:28
And having a strong, reliable
identity is the basis
05:28->05:30
of confidence and self-efficacy.
05:30->05:32
And there's no better feeling than that.
05:32->05:36
So if you're beaten and battered
and tired from the strife,
05:36->05:39
then follow these eight steps
and (censored) your life.

AG1 is the simplest way
05:46->05:50
to keep your mind and
body energized, optimized,
05:50->05:52
and focused throughout the day.
05:52->05:55
You guys know that AG1 is by
far my favorite supplement.
05:55->05:57
And that's because there's no competing
05:57->05:59
with its nutritional profile.
05:59->06:02
And since it's sourced from whole foods,
06:02->06:04
it's extremely bioavailable,
06:04->06:06
which means when you drink AG1,
06:06->06:08
your body can actually absorb
06:08->06:10
and use all of the nutrients and vitamins
06:10->06:12
instead of urinating it out
06:12->06:14
like so many cheaper multivitamins.
06:14->06:16
So staying healthy and mentally sharp is
06:16->06:18
as easy as it's ever been.
06:18->06:19
So if you're interested in joining me
06:19->06:23

self-optimization health habit,
06:23->06:26
then if you use my link

06:27->06:30
