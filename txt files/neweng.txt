Idea 1.The illusion of light and fast money, “fast money on the exchange”, the author promotes the idea of ​​rapid enrichment through speculative transactions on the exchange, not taking into account the risks and possible losses...Excerpt: “Before the company entering the market, we buy one hundred thousand shares of twenty -five cents per share. Six months later, the company is included in the listing (registered on the exchange), and these shares are already worth two dollars. If the company is well managed, the price continues to growAnd the shares can rise to twenty dollars or even higher that our twenty -five thousand turn into a million in less than a year. ”.This is the author’s delusion, because the game on the exchange, especially using speculative transactions, is fraught with large financial risks.Not all companies achieve success in the market, and such investments can lead to serious losses.Following this advice can lead to financial problems and even to the loss of all invested funds ...Council to society: Avoid speculative transactions on the exchange and do not consider them as a quick way of enrichment.It is better to invest in long -term stable assets, develop financial literacy and make deliberate decisions.

Idea 3.Investing in the shares for a short time.The author offers to invest in the shares of companies for a short time, waiting for quick profit.He claims that on average of ten investments he makes a profit for two or three, and the rest incur losses.This can lead to a loss of large amounts of money, since investment for a short time is fraught with large risks, especially for inexperienced investors .. Excerculous from the book: “Often my broker calls me and advises to invest a solid amount in the company’s campaign, which, apparently, isIt is about to take a step that will increase its quotes, for example, I will introduce my money from a week to a month, while the shares are growing in price.because my money is again for me and are ready to work in other assets.

Council to society: Investing for a short time requires serious knowledge and experience, so before making such decisions, it is worth contacting professionals and studying the market.Do not risk large amounts of money if there is no confidence in your actions.
Idea 4."The invention of money", the author calls for dubious financial transactions that can lead to serious consequences ...An excerpt from the book: “I lent my friend two thousand dollars for three months, promising him to return two hundred dollars more, and gave the lawyer a bank check as a first contribution for a mortgage loan of twenty thousand dollars.
While the deal was drawn up, I gave an announcement in the newspaper for the sale of such an expensive house for only sixty thousand dollars without paying in cash.The phone called without stopping.A list of promising buyers was compiled, and as soon as the house became my legal property, they all were invited to inspect it.Real excitement began.The house was sold in just a couple of minutes.I requested two and a half thousand dollars for drawing up a transaction that I was handed right away.Two thousand of them and two hundred from above I returned to a friend.He was satisfied, as well as the buyer of the house, a lawyer and myself.I sold a house for sixty thousand dollars, which cost me only twenty.These forty thousand dollars were created in my asset column in the form of a buyer’s debt receipt.

I quickly became boring, and I was distracted.In 1984, I began to teach people with the help of games and modeling life situations and still rely on these tools. ".
This is a misconception, since lectures can be an effective teaching method, and games and modeling are not always able to convey the necessary knowledge and skills.Relying exclusively on games in education can lead to insufficient assimilation of material and unpreparedness to real challenges of life ...Council for society: Do not completely deny the value of lectures and traditional teaching methods.It is important to combine various approaches for the maximum effectiveness of the educational process.The author says that since 1984 it has earned millions, doing something that is not included in the education program.Tip: Be careful with coachs who claim to earn what they teach others in business.Often such coaches themselves earn in training, and not on real business experience.They can transmit theoretical knowledge gained from various sources, but it is not necessary to have a successful business that they refer to.It is important to check the details of their business, which, according to them, brings the main income.

Whenever you lack something, or you need something, first give it to others, and you will be rewarded with a hundredfold.This rule is applicable to money, smiles, love and friendship.I understand that sometimes I want to do this the least, but this method always helped me.I just believe in the principle of reversibility and give what I need.When I need money, I give it, and they return to me in many times.When I need to increase sales, I help someone else sell something, after which the volume of my sales jumps up sharply.When I need connections, I help someone else find the right people, and useful connections appear in me, as if by magic.Many years ago, I heard a wise saying: "God does not need to be received, but people need to be given."My rich dad often said: "The poor are more prone to greed than the rich."He explained that when a person is rich, he gives other people what they want.When I, "" this principle can lead to irrational spending of money, energy and time for charity or help to others, waiting for repeated return.In reality, this may not work, and a person runs the risk of being financial difficulties due to this approach.In addition, the idea that the poor are more prone to greed than the rich are exaggerated and does not reflect reality. "Some business trains and coachs say that in order to achieve success you need to be ready to share their resources and money.

"," The author’s advice that the Stop Losses help minimize losses can lead to the fact that investors will ignore a fundamental analysis and rely solely on automatic sales when the price of shares falls.This can lead to an omission of the opportunity to get long -term profit from investment, since the funds market are subject to fluctuations and corrections that can be temporary.The use of stop-flashes of orders without a proper understanding of risks can lead to losses and missed capabilities.
